# f1tenth_system

Drivers onboard f1tenth race cars. This branch is under development for migration to ROS2. See the [documentation of F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/foxy_test/getting_started/firmware/index.html) on how to get started.

## Cloning submodules
If you clone this repository, make sure to clone the submodules as well. You can do this by running:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

This will ensure you have all the submodules cloned and updated to the configured branches.

## Deadman's switch
On Logitech F-710 joysticks, the LB button is the deadman's switch for teleop, and the RB button is the deadman's switch for navigation. You can also remap buttons. See how on the readthedocs documentation.

## Sick Lidar

Note that sick_scan_xd does not have an apt package for ROS2 foxy, you can try installing [from source](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd). Follow these steps to install sick_scan_xd on Linux for ROS 2 Humble:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-sick-scan-xd
```

**Warning:** Make sure to use the `sick_tim_5xx.launch` file located in the `f1tenth_stack` package's launch directory:

`<f1tenth_stack>/launch/sick_tim_5xx.launch`

Bring up with `ros2 launch f1tenth_stack sick_bringup_launch.py`. This file is an updated version of the original `sick_tim_5xx.launch` file that changes the "frame_id" to "laser" and "tf_base_frame_id" to "base_link", which is compatible with the slam_toolbox and particle filter. You will still need to set the IP address of the lidar in the launch file.

Bring up with `ros2 launch f1tenth_stack sick_bringup_launch.py`

See the [documentation of F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/foxy_test/getting_started/firmware/index.html) on how to get started.

### Getting SICK Lidar IP

The lidar is delivered with a standard IP address. There are two ways to read or change the IP address:

1. **Using a Windows Computer :** Install [SICK SOPAS ET](https://www.sick.com/de/de/sopas-engineering-tool-2018/p/p367244) and follow [the instructions in the sick_scan_xd package](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd?tab=readme-ov-file#starting-with-a-new-lidar).

2. **Using a Linux Computer :** You can scan the network for the lidar IP address using the following command:

```bash
nmap -sn
```

If you have a SICK lidar connected to the network, you will see the IP address of the lidar in the output.

## Topics
